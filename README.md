# digitaljournal
This is a GUI application which you can write daily journals with. You can browse old journal entries, you can edit old journal entries, you can sort these entries in the main
windows listbox by name in ascending and descending order, as well as in chronological order. What's great about this is that it is persistent thanks to the 'db.py' which saves
the journal entries and their information json format written to the working directory.
